### Doroud (ÿØÿ±ŸàÿØ) - Hello üëã

 üòà My name is Ali Reza, but you can call me **Ali** or **Aro**. I was born in a small city in the south of Iran near the Persian Gulf, which has an amazing beach, and I loved to spend time there and take some images. Currently, I'm a PhD Student at BioMedico Rome University, and I have been doing research at SI-Lab at the Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI) of the Italian National Research Council (CNR). Additionally, I am doing my visiting research at the Lanovaz Lab at the University of Montreal. Needless to say, I'm an organized, motivated Artificial intelligence advocate who is eager to learn more. I have been trying to do my best in Academia for the past 5 years and have worked in the realm of Image, Audio Processing, and Large Language Models.

 üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I‚Äôm currently working on several projects such as **HDR Imaging**, **Image segmentation**, **Autism detection** based on facial images using deep learning analyzing the methods using Explainable AI method, and Vocal Stereotypy detection in autistic children, which I believe is extremely an interesting Project.


### Experiences:
* **Researcher | 06/2022 - Present**

  **SI-Lab in ISTI Department of National Research Council ‚Äì Pisa, Italy**
  * Developed and designed HDR imaging models using image segmentation and hyperparameter tuning from scratch.
  *  Implemented facial recognition and audio processing models to distinguish autistic children using Vision Transformers (ViT), Explainable AI, and transfer learning techniques.
  *  Developed user-friendly software for psychologists with no knowledge of coding to use a machine learning model.
  *  Implementing deep neural network in 3D Joint Skeleton to recognize Movement Stereotypy.

* **Visiting Research | 12/2023 - 05/2024**

  **University of Montreal - Montreal, Canada**
  * Researched vocal stereotypy detection in autistic children‚Äôs audio, addressing imbalanced data with preprocessing and normalization techniques.
  * Applied transfer learning on various models, including Vision Transformers (ViT), to enhance performance.
  * Developed user-friendly software for our vocal stereotypy model for practitioners and psychologists.
  * Worked with a multidisciplinary and multicultural team.

* **Researcher | 01/2021 - 12/2021**

  **Kharazmi University - Tehran, Iran**
  * Conducted research on Super-Resolution Imaging, specifically on the project titled ‚ÄùPerceptual Image Super Resolution‚Äù.
  * Developed and implemented a new weighted Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function to improve edge detection in the super-resolution process.
  * Contributed to the field of image processing by focusing on enhancing the quality of upscaled images.
 
* **Teacher Assistant | 01/2019 - 09/2020**

  **Kharazmi University - Tehran, Iran**
