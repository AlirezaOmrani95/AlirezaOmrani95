### Doroud (درود) - Hello 👋

 😈 My name is Ali Reza but you can call me **Ali** or **Aro**. I was born in a small city in the south of Iran near the Persian Gulf, which has an amazing beach, and I loved to spend time there and take some images. Currently, I'm a PhD Student at BioMedico Rome University, and I have been doing research at SI-Lab at the Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI) of the Italian National Research Council (CNR). Additionally, I am doing my visiting research at Lanovaz Lab at the University of Montreal. Needless to say, I have a huge interest in Technology and would like to spend too much time in the realm of Computer vision and AI.

 👨🏻‍💻 I’m currently working on several projects such as **HDR Imaging**, **Image segmentation**, **Autism detection** based on facial images using deep learning analyzing the methods using Explainable AI method, and Vocal Stereotypy detection in autistic children, which I believe is extremely an interesting Project.
