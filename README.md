### Doroud (ÿØÿ±ŸàÿØ) - Hello üëã

 üòà My name is Ali Reza but you can call me **Ali** or **Aro**. I was born in a small city in the south of Iran near the Persian Gulf, which has an amazing beach, and I loved to spend time there and take some images. Currently, I'm a PhD Student at BioMedico Rome University, and I have been doing research at SI-Lab at the Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI) of the Italian National Research Council (CNR). Additionally, I am doing my visiting research at Lanovaz Lab at the University of Montreal. Needless to say, I'm an organized, motivated, Artificial intelligence advocate, who is eager to learn more. I have been trying to do my best in Academia for the past 5 years and have worked in the realm of Image and Audio Processing.

 üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I‚Äôm currently working on several projects such as **HDR Imaging**, **Image segmentation**, **Autism detection** based on facial images using deep learning analyzing the methods using Explainable AI method, and Vocal Stereotypy detection in autistic children, which I believe is extremely an interesting Project.

### Skills:
