### Doroud (ÿØÿ±ŸàÿØ) - Hello üëã

My name is Ali Reza, but you can call me **Ali** or **Aro**. I was born in a small city in southern Iran near the Persian Gulf, known for its beautiful beaches, where I always enjoyed visiting and photographing. Currently, I'm a researcher at SI-Lab, part of the Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI) at the Italian National Research Council (CNR) in Pisa, Italy. I also had the opportunity to conduct  visiting research at the Lanovaz Lab at the University of Montreal. 

As an enthusiastic advocate for Artificial Intelligence, I‚Äôm constantly driven to learn and explore more in the field. Over the past five years, I‚Äôve been deeply involved in academic research, working across a range of areas including computer vision, audio processing, and large language models.

### Experiences:
* **Researcher | 06/2022 - Present**

  **SI-Lab in ISTI Department of National Research Council ‚Äì Pisa, Italy**
  * Developed and designed innovative HDR imaging models using image segmentation and hyperparameter tuning from scratch.
  * Implemented facial recognition and audio processing models to distinguish autistic children using Vision Transformers (ViT), Explainable AI, and transfer learning techniques.
  * Developed user-friendly software for psychologists with no knowledge of coding to use a machine learning model.
  * Implementing deep neural networks in the 3D Joint Skeleton to recognize Movement Stereotypy.
  * Used LLM models for text and image data extraction, applying LLMs to process and extract meaningful features, integrating outputs into other systems, and developing systems to interpret and integrate text and image data.

* **Visiting Research | 12/2023 - 05/2024**

  **University of Montreal - Montreal, Canada**
  * Researched vocal stereotypy detection in autistic children‚Äôs audio, addressing imbalanced data with preprocessing and normalization techniques.
  * Applied transfer learning on various models, including Vision Transformers (ViT), to enhance performance.
  * Developed user-friendly software for our vocal stereotypy model for practitioners and psychologists.
  * Worked with a multidisciplinary and multicultural team.

* **Researcher | 01/2021 - 12/2021**

  **Kharazmi University - Tehran, Iran**
  * Conducted research on Super-Resolution Imaging, specifically on the project titled ‚ÄùPerceptual Image Super Resolution‚Äù.
  * Developed and implemented a new weighted Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function to improve edge detection in the super-resolution process.
  * Contributed to the field of image processing by focusing on enhancing the quality of upscaled images.
 
* **Teacher Assistant | 01/2019 - 09/2020**

  **Kharazmi University - Tehran, Iran**
  * Worked as a teacher assistant for the Artificial Neural Network Course for four semesters.
  * Led the TA team, coordinating and overseeing the work of other assistants.
  * Worked as a teacher assistant for the Machine Learning Course for one semester.
  * Provided students with hands-on projects to enhance their practical understanding of Artificial Neural Networks and Machine Learning.

### Projects
#### Current Projects
 * **LLM HR Assistant**
   
Developing a multi-agent and multi-platform system that leverages NLP-based techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs) to compute and analyze the semantic similarity between candidate CVs and job postings, aiming to assess relevance and guide resume tailoring.
 * **Movement Stereotypy Classification**
   
Developing a Deep Learning model to analyze and classify movement stereotypy in autistic children by interpreting sequences of 3D joint skeleton data, capturing their body movements, and identifying specific movement patterns indicative of stereotypy.

#### Finished Projects
* **Vocal Stereotypy Detection**
   
Developed a deep learning model that measures vocal stereotypy with high accuracy and a strong correlation with human observations, reducing the need for human observers. Also implemented a software that works as a user interface for the model.
* **Explainable AI for Autism Detection**
   
Developed a deep learning model to distinguish autistic from non autistic children, based on one facial image. Moreover, explainable AI methods were used to enhance the model‚Äôs transparency and interpretability.
* **HDR Imaging with Visual Attention Modules**
   
Developed a novel deep learning model using a Visual Attention Module (VAM) to highlight the most visible areas of each image, outperforming most existing SOTA algorithms. The novelty of this project is the use of the image segmentation concept in image reconstruction.
* **Supervised Image Segmentation for HDR Imaging**
   
Aimed to detect the most visible areas using image segmentation. Trained neural networks to segment the visible parts of images effectively.
